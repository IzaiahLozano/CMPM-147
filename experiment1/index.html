				<h2>Description</h2>
				<p>What are you trying to acomplish with this experiment?</p>
				<p>I'm trying to make at least an interesting intro to a murder mystery. I'm not sure how the different fillers will interact though. I kind of wanted it to be funny so I decided to throw in some funny fillers to see hwo the results will turn out.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Technical</h2>
				<p>Describe in detail what you did technically and how it works?</p>
				<p>When I ran into issues on my website I would use inspect element to see what errors were popping up and this would help me to debug my code. But alos reading everything carefully helped too. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>Each person that worked on the code should reflect on the process, the difficulties, and the successes of the experiment.</p>
				<p>This project wasn't too bad, I did strugggle a bit with some of the code but it wasn't hard to debug. I wasn't spending hours trying to fix one problem so that was great. I do wish I wrote a better script and found a way to better work in the filler words but I'm pretty happy with what came out of it. It's more funny then I thought, or maybe my humor is broken.</p>
