				<h2>Description</h2>
				<p>For this iteration I was inspired by a classmate, Garret Blake with their experiement 4(https://tblagarrett.github.io/cmpm147/experiment4bNoColor/index.html). I thought the waves were really cool, so to make it my own, instead of making the waves react to the clicking I made it a constant wave look. With this look I decided to make a boat and and have the water change with it's movement.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Technical</h2>
				<p>For the waves it was a combination of a counter and some math equations to make the tiles move. I then used an array of shades of blue to use for a gradual switch of the ocean's colors. I then made the boat out of simple shape and edited the shadow to match the boats outline. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>I enjoyed messing with this one the most. I thought it was super cool to watch the tiles move like water and the boat sitting on the wave tiles made it look as if it were moving too. The color switch was a beautiful touch as well. I felt it made the water look a bit more realistic. </p>
