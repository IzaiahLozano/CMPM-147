				<h2>Description</h2>
				<p>In this experiment I took inspiration from Candyland. My biggest thing was that I wanted it to make all the tiles pink; I guess I was influenced by PinkSweat$, and RnB artist. Whatever the reason I decided to make a Cotton Candy region of Candyland. When I ran with this idea I then thoguht it'd be cool to add cotton candy trees into the world.

				<h2>Technical</h2>
				<p>
					To accomplish my vision I created an array of shades fo pink. I didn't just want one color, I felt that it'd be cool and nicer if I added a small variety. Then to make the trees I just made a rectangle and attached three circles to give the trees a cartoonish, playful look and puffy look like cotton candy. I then made two more arrays to hold the color for the 'leaves' of the tree; picking between shades of pink and blue.

				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>Like the instructions said, this one was the hardest to work on. I ran into a lot of walls and took a lot of time messing with the code to figure out the borders(ironically). The colors was probably the hardest, because I originally just wanted the trees to be a solid color but quickly I found out that with the random function use it made the colors change sporadically. Which then opened the door to other inspirations for the rest of my experiments.</p>
