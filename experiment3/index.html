				<h2>Description</h2>
				<p>There are two parts to this experiment. For the overworld I was looking to create a biodiverse landscape surrounded by water. Something very similar to the example shown. For the Underworld I wanted to make a dungeon lair with multiple caves and a random chance that a treaure chest would appear. With every click of the reseed button a new generation of the worlds will be created providing a unique landscape with every click. The users could also use a text box to edit the canvas directly and change the map to their liking.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Technical</h2>
				<p>A lot of what I did came down to multiple for loops and if statements. I need to fill the canvas with a mix of characters like '_' or '$'. These charcaters woudl then help me when I would iterate over the canvas and checking the characters. If the specific character was found a tile would be placed in the exact same x,y coordinate as in the text box but in the canvas. For the worm I used an ellipses and another for loop to draw the worm across the land. For the chest chance I needed a simple math equation of probability and added that in whent he canvas was generated. </p>
			</div>

				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>Overall this was definitley the most challenging experiements we've gotten so far. I wanted to have the water move like int he example but I couldn't figure out the code to do it correctly, it also didn't help that I couldn't get percise coordinates for the tile map. This one definitley challenged my coding skills. Even more so when trying to add both screens onto the same page. Luckily I got help from Alex to get the boxs on the same page. Half of the time spent on this project was debugging. A lot of things I would try would break the canvas in weird ways. Some helped the creative process and some were just plain frusturating. Overall the experiment was a creative and technical challenge that pushed me.</p>
