                    <p>Relation to inspring image:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Color: The sky, grass, mushrooms, and river colors were sampled from the inspiring image using a website eyedropper tool.</li>
                        <li>Primitives: The sky is rendered with `rectangle` primitives.</li>
                        <li>Polygons: The background river is a single randomly polygon using `vertex` calls.</li>
                        <li>Composition: Different random seed values lead to differently shaped mushroom caps, stems and stars.</li>
                        <li>Life: The mushroom caps spin along as the stems but those are harder to tell since there are no strokes. The river also moves as if it's breathign I wanted to warp it more but I couldn't figure out how to curve it as such so I was stuck with a straight lined river. The stars also twinkle over time.</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                </div>

				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>My vision was a lot more ambitious than the time I had for this project as well as my knowledge of P5JS. It was cool though to see what I could do. I had a lot of fails but it was fun to try things out and mess witht he code. Especially witht he P5JS library it really helped me to better understand the code better. Some stuff I'm still a little confused on how it acted the way it did but with future projects I'm sure it'll make sense.</p>
